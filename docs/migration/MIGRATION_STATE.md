## Bootstrap verification (completed)

Prerequisites confirmed for the current phase (later-phase tools audited in their own phases):

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Repository root | `E:/dopplefit` |
| `origin` remote | `getRabbi/wear-the-mood` |
| `origin/main` SHA | `98df3c359ff711d4949e27b7ac2de4528602829b` (matches locked base) |
| Working tree | clean (blueprint input doc locally excluded via `.git/info/exclude`) |
| Blueprint readable | yes |
| DigitalOcean SSH (`root@159.65.248.247`, host `fashion-os`) | reachable, read-only OK |
| Docker daemon | Docker Desktop, `linux/amd64` engine responding |
| GitHub (`gh`) | authenticated as `getRabbi`; scopes include `repo`, `workflow`, `write:packages` |
| Heroku | authenticated (`wearthemood24@gmail.com`) |
| Azure (`az`) | `Azure for Students`, Enabled, subscription `…b5cc` |

## Confirmed operating decisions

- Heroku production API and the DigitalOcean bridge use the Supabase **Session Pooler on port 5432**.
- Use **direct DB access** for backup when reachable; **Session Pooler 5432** is the IPv4 fallback.
- Do **not** switch runtime to Transaction Pooler 6543 unless Phase 0 finds a concrete requirement.
- Heroku and Azure authentication are already active.
- The human handles: browser approval, MFA, GPG passphrase, Supabase project-creation confirmation, DNS cutover authorization, and final resource-deletion authorization.

## Locked cost guards (from blueprint §3.4)

- GHCR is the canonical registry (no Azure Container Registry). No Azure VM/DB/Redis/Service Bus/Front Door/API Management.
- Azure: Storage **Queue** only (Standard_LRS), Container Apps **Consumption** only; Log Analytics ≤ 30-day retention if required.
- Heroku prod: exactly one **Basic** web dyno; staging on **Eco**; no paid add-ons.
- No Supabase Pro upgrade in this migration. No FASHN paid tier / auto top-up.

## Change log

- **Bootstrap** — created `migration/heroku-azure` from `origin/main@98df3c3`; created this file; verified current-phase prerequisites.
