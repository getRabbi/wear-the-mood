## Current position

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Working branch | `migration/heroku-azure` |
| Base commit (`origin/main`) | `98df3c359ff711d4949e27b7ac2de4528602829b` |
| Current phase | **Phase 6 IN PROGRESS — candidates only.** **All 9 Azure Jobs on CI-built images** (8 orchestrator → `b9817f63`, rembg → `1749dea3`; both proven to run) + migration `0045` applied + Heroku **staging** released (v37, `18bb4ac`). CI image pipeline **unblocked** (GHCR packages linked + Write; `migration-build` green, all 3 digests verified). Heroku **prod RELEASED to v5** (`0851595`) via gated CI; `GIT_SHA` stamp synced to main (PR #2). **Heroku ACM enabled** (`Failing — CDN not returning HTTP challenge`, expected until DNS moves). **Cloudflare token now VERIFIED** (Zone:Read + DNS:Read + DNS:Edit proven by a reverted write probe). **✅ QUEUE BLOCKER RESOLVED — Heroku API can now signal Azure** (queue-scoped SAS minted + wired; proven end-to-end: stored credential → HTTP 201 → message in `jobs` → KEDA woke `wtm-rembg-job-kpmw9` → drained to 0). **DNS cutover authorization stands; flip not yet executed.** Prior blocker, now fixed: **the Heroku API had NO queue wiring** (`QUEUE_PROVIDER` and every `AZURE_*` var unset across all 40 config vars → it runs `StubQueue`, a no-op). It therefore cannot signal the Azure workers, which are **event-triggered only**. Flipping DNS would silently degrade every background removal / try-on from near-instant to the 5-minute recovery poll + ~100 s cold start. **Nothing was changed — DNS, DO worker, and Azure schedules all untouched.** Fix = give the Heroku API queue credentials (managed identity is unavailable outside Azure, so it needs a scoped SAS/connection string) before re-attempting. **✅ All three mandatory preflight checks remain PROVEN** (cutout livelock fixed by `0046` + `cutout_locked_at`; replica-kill recovery proven deterministically `attempt_count` 1→2 on `wtm-rembg-job-xlk7v`; re-signal attribution proven; DO/Azure never overlap). **Awaiting `AUTHORIZE DNS CUTOVER`.** Production restored and healthy: DO worker+ofelia running, Azure recovery + all crons `0 0 31 2 *`, api/site/`/r/*` 200/200/302, baseline 28/27, **DNS untouched** |
| Last completed | Phase 5 — load / throughput / failure / cost gates measured, remediated, re-verified from a US-region generator, and **approved** |
| Heroku prod candidate | **RELEASED + current** — `wtm-api-prod` **v5** (2026-07-20T07:19Z) via CI `migration-deploy` `29723080914` from `0851595` (remediated backend, incl. §F contract fix). `/readyz` 200 `db:true`, `/healthz` 200, `/v1/health` 200. **Still UNROUTED** (DNS unchanged). ⚠ `/readyz` `commit` shows stale `17a3a8c` — CI release doesn't update the `GIT_SHA` config var (cosmetic; real code is `0851595`). |
| DigitalOcean role | **LIVE PRODUCTION on the US DB** (api+worker+ofelia repointed to `us-east-1`) — bridge until Phase 6 compute cutover + 48h soak. **Untouched by Phases 4 and 5.** |
| Authoritative DB | **Supabase US `ghzabbceoaoertatkjyg` (us-east-1)** — Tokyo retained as cold backup (do NOT delete) |
| Next human approval phrase | `APPROVED PHASE 6` — **plus** a separate `AUTHORIZE DNS CUTOVER` inside the phase. Approving Phase 6 alone does **not** authorize a DNS change |

## Bootstrap verification (completed)

Prerequisites confirmed for the current phase (later-phase tools audited in their own phases):

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Repository root | `E:/dopplefit` |
| `origin` remote | `getRabbi/wear-the-mood` |
| `origin/main` SHA | `98df3c359ff711d4949e27b7ac2de4528602829b` (matches locked base) |
| Working tree | clean (blueprint input doc locally excluded via `.git/info/exclude`) |
| Blueprint readable | yes |
| DigitalOcean SSH (`root@159.65.248.247`, host `fashion-os`) | reachable, read-only OK |
| Docker daemon | Docker Desktop, `linux/amd64` engine responding |
| GitHub (`gh`) | authenticated as `getRabbi`; scopes include `repo`, `workflow`, `write:packages` |
| Heroku | authenticated (`wearthemood24@gmail.com`) |
| Azure (`az`) | `Azure for Students`, Enabled, subscription `…b5cc` |

---

## Confirmed operating decisions

- Heroku production API and the DigitalOcean bridge use the Supabase **Session Pooler on port 5432**.
- Use **direct DB access** for backup when reachable; **Session Pooler 5432** is the IPv4 fallback.
- Do **not** switch runtime to Transaction Pooler 6543 unless Phase 0 finds a concrete requirement.
- Heroku and Azure authentication are already active.
- The human handles: browser approval, MFA, GPG passphrase, Supabase project-creation confirmation, DNS cutover authorization, and final resource-deletion authorization.

---

## Locked cost guards (from blueprint §3.4)

- GHCR is the canonical registry (no Azure Container Registry). No Azure VM/DB/Redis/Service Bus/Front Door/API Management.
- Azure: Storage **Queue** only (Standard_LRS), Container Apps **Consumption** only; Log Analytics ≤ 30-day retention if required.
- Heroku prod: exactly one **Basic** web dyno; staging on **Eco**; no paid add-ons.
- No Supabase Pro upgrade in this migration. No FASHN paid tier / auto top-up.

---

## ⛔ MANDATORY PHASE 6 PREFLIGHT — post-DO-shutdown recovery attribution

These CANNOT be proven while the DigitalOcean worker is live, because DO's
`requeue_stale` fires at **120s** while the Azure lease is **300s** — DO always
recovers a stale row first, so any result is attributed to DO, not Azure. Each was
attempted in Phase 5 and returned `attempt_count 0 -> 0`, the DO signature.

**Run all three AFTER the DO worker and ofelia are stopped, BEFORE `AUTHORIZE DNS CUTOVER`:**

1. **Replica-kill recovery attribution** — kill a `wtm-rembg-job` execution mid-batch;
   the claimed row must be re-claimed and completed by a later execution, with
   `attempt_count` incrementing (proving Azure, not DO, recovered it).
2. **Azure recovery re-signal attribution** — leave a claimable row with NO queue
   message; `wtm-prod-recovery` must re-signal it and an Azure execution must
   complete it with `attempt_count >= 1`.
3. **Overlap verification** — confirm the 120s DO stale-recovery window and the 300s
   Azure lease can never both be active. The two worker planes must never run
   cutouts concurrently; the cutover must stop the DO worker before Azure takes
   cutout traffic.

Until then these three gates are **explicitly unproven**, not passed.

## ✅ BINDING CONDITION SATISFIED — Cloudflare Pages candidate (was deferred from Phase 4)

The Phase 4 deferral is **closed**. The candidate was deployed and preview-verified on
2026-07-19 with a correctly-scoped token, **without touching production DNS**.

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Pages project | `wtm-site` · environment **preview**, branch `migration-candidate` |
| Preview URL | `https://migration-candidate.wtm-site.pages.dev` (immutable: `8939dac3.wtm-site.pages.dev`) |
| Custom domains attached | **`wtm-site.pages.dev` only — `wearthemood.com` NOT attached** |
| Token scope | Account · Pages only — `/user/tokens/verify` 403s while the Pages API succeeds, proving it cannot reach User or Zone endpoints (so it cannot alter DNS) |

Every required check passed: landing, all three legal pages, `/invite/`, `delete-account`,
`_headers` (content-type **and** cache rules), **`/.well-known/assetlinks.json` 200 `application/json`**,
**`/.well-known/apple-app-site-association` 200 `application/json` with no redirect**, and `/r/*`
(proven earlier against the Heroku candidate). Full detail in `PHASE_4_REPORT.md` §4.3.

**⚠ One delta carried into Phase 6:** Pages strips `.html` and 308-redirects to the canonical
extensionless URL, where the droplet serves `.html` directly at 200. Content is byte-correct
after the redirect and store crawlers follow 308s, but the published Privacy / Terms /
delete-account URLs should be updated to the extensionless form at cutover. `.well-known`
files are unaffected.

**Still binding for Phase 6:** production DNS remains unchanged until `AUTHORIZE DNS CUTOVER`.
The Pages token must NOT be reused for cutover work — that needs a separate **Zone · Read +
Zone · DNS · Edit** token, issued only when Phase 6 begins. The two earlier credentials (one
exposed in chat, one invalid) remain burned and must be revoked.

## Phase 0 headlines (full detail in `DISCOVERY.md`)

- **System:** 1 DO droplet (Ubuntu 24.04, 2 vCPU, 3.8 GiB), compose `fashionos` = `api`+`worker`+`admin-web`+`caddy`+`ofelia`. Supabase Tokyo **PG 17.6, 19 MB**. Media = **Supabase Storage** (120 objects / ~72 MB). No Redis/broker; DB-poll worker; claims use `SKIP LOCKED`; credits idempotent.
- **Tests:** backend `580 passed, 2 skipped` (local venv). CI red = **formatting only** (tests pass), pre-existing on main.
- **No hard blockers.** Amendments needing a Gate 0 decision:
  1. **(Major)** media is on Supabase Storage → Phase 3 migrates ~72 MB + rewrites legacy public URLs.
  2. **Admin console is ON the droplet** → propose Heroku Eco `wtm-admin`.
  3. **Static site + `/r/*` on droplet Caddy** → Cloudflare Pages + Heroku-API route.
  4. Phase-2 reliability: recovery + attempt/lease fields for `tryon_jobs`/`ai_jobs`; output-row uniqueness; external status mapping.
  5. Runtime DSN → **Session Pooler 5432** (no requirement forces 6543).
- **Cost impact of Phase 0:** zero (no cloud resource created).

## Phase 1 headlines

- **Complete encrypted backup taken + restore-verified.** One AES-256 GPG archive at `r2://fashionos-private/migration-backups/2026-07-18/wtm-phase1-backup-20260718.tar.gpg` (SHA `9b4f7b59…`): DB roles/schema/data (incl. auth + 12 password hashes), 120 Storage objects (76.5 MB), droplet config, git bundle.
- **Restore test PASS** — restored into a fresh local Supabase stack: 0 errors, all counts match source, FK integrity holds.
- DO snapshot `wtm-pre-migration-20260718` taken (live, droplet 577335646). Baseline tag `pre-migration-20260718` → `98df3c3` pushed. **Retention: keep all backups + snapshot through 2026-09-01.**
- Owner still to provide: DO snapshot **ID**; Cloudflare lifecycle confirmation on `fashionos-private`.

## Phase 2 headlines (full detail in `PHASE_2_REPORT.md`)

- **New deployable units built on-branch; DO unchanged.** 11 small commits: queue abstraction, migration `0044` (attempt/lease/signal/output-uniqueness), split `rembg_worker`/`ai_orchestrator` + `wtm-recovery`, `/healthz`+`/readyz`+maintenance+emergency guard, external status mapping, API enqueue-after-commit, `app.tasks.*` cron wrappers, 3 Dockerfiles, GitHub Actions (GHCR build + gated Heroku deploy), Azure Bicep, Cloudflare route plan.
- **Backend suite: 625 passed / 2 skipped** (+45). API image builds at 461 MB; Bicep compiles clean (13 resources); migration 0044 validated + idempotent. Secret scan clean.
- **Backward compatible:** legacy `status` kept (new `state` added), `/v1/health` kept, combined worker + `app.cron.*` + `docker-compose.yml` untouched. Migration 0044 NOT applied to Tokyo (applied to US project in Phase 3).
- **Follow-ups (non-blocking):** CI `ruff format --check` needs a one-time `ruff format .` (pre-existing drift); rembg model checksum-pin is a hardening TODO; Azure schedule jobs stay disabled until Phase 4.

## Phase 4 headlines (full detail in `PHASE_4_REPORT.md`)

- **Resumed after an interruption.** Recovery audit reconciled cloud/Git/Docker state first: Heroku apps + 2 of 3 GHCR images already existed (reused, not recreated); `wtm-rembg-worker` had never been pushed; Azure was completely empty. No ambiguous non-idempotent operation.
- **Heroku:** `wtm-api-prod` release **v4**, Basic ×1, 40 config vars, `/readyz` = `db:true, commit 17a3a8c`. `wtm-api-staging` v35, same immutable image digest, scaled to **0** after testing. `api.wearthemood.com` registered on the app (DNS target recorded) — **no DNS changed**.
- **Azure `wtm-prod` / `koreacentral`, 14 resources, deployment Succeeded.** Storage Queue only, UAMI + Storage Queue Data Contributor (least privilege), Consumption ACA, workers 0→3 on queue depth at the exact locked CPU/memory, emergency API guarded off, all 3 images pinned by **digest**, 12 ACA secret refs, private GHCR pull proven.
- **Two defects found + fixed:** (1) the six cron jobs were commented "disabled" but had **live schedules** — would have duplicated ofelia against production; now `0 0 31 2 *` behind `cronSchedulesEnabled=false`. (2) `DefaultAzureCredential` could not resolve the **user-assigned** identity — added `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` to `baseEnv`; queue auth now 200.
- **E2E proven with attribution.** A first run was silently handled by the **DO worker**; re-run isolated (insert as `processing` w/ stale lease) and confirmed Azure via `attempt_count=1`. Cold pickup **44.3 s** (gate <90 s), warm **2.9 s** (gate <20 s), duplicate signal = no-op, garbage drained, recovery job Succeeded, queues drain to 0, **94.6 vCPU-s / 189.2 GiB-s per job**. Zero test-data residue (totals back to 28 items / 27 users).
- **⚠ Phase 6 hazard found:** DO's `requeue_stale` is **120 s** but the Azure lease is **300 s** — concurrent planes would let DO requeue an item Azure is still processing. The DO worker must be stopped before Azure takes cutout traffic.
- **Cost:** Azure budget `wtm-prod-monthly` created **programmatically** ($100 base → alerts at exactly $10/$25/$50/$75/$90 + forecast). Azure MTD **$0**. Heroku **$12.00/mo** ≤ $13 gate.
- **Gate reopened + corrected (owner subscribed to Eco).** The first pass wrongly treated Eco as a per-app charge and rejected `wtm-admin` as +$7/mo. **Eco is one account-wide $5 plan with 1,000 dyno-hours shared across all personal Eco apps**, so a second Eco app is $0 marginal. Now: staging **Eco ×1**, `wtm-admin` created + deployed **Eco ×1** (rebuilt against **US** Supabase — closes the Phase 3 Tokyo follow-up; root 404s, unauthenticated `/dashboard` → 307 login, `noindex`). Approved allocation $7 + $5 = **$12/mo**.
- **Eco behaviour verified:** staging `up`→`idle` at 21:08:55Z (~30 min idle), wakes in **11.6 s** (`db:true`); admin confirmed idle, wakes in **7.9 s** with the auth gate intact. **No pingers** — no add-ons, no scheduled workflows, no `herokuapp.com` refs in code, none from the droplet. Pool at **998h 21m (99%)** remaining. Recorded in `OPS_RUNBOOK.md` §5.1.
- **`/r/*` verified on the Heroku candidate** — 302 → `https://wearthemood.com/`, identical to the live DO route, with no route change.
- **Cloudflare Pages still owner-gated:** the supplied token was rejected by every auth scheme (`1000`/`9109`/`10000`/`9103`) and was **cleared, not stored**; needs **Account · Cloudflare Pages · Edit** (no Zone/DNS scope). Prepared meanwhile: `deploy/site/_headers` pins `application/json` on `apple-app-site-association` (extensionless → Pages would serve `octet-stream` and silently break Universal Links).
- Tests **627 passed**; secret scan clean; repo changes: `infra/azure/main.bicep`, `deploy/site/_headers`, `OPS_RUNBOOK.md`.

## Phase 5 headlines (full detail in `PHASE_5_REPORT.md`)

- **Performance gates all PASS with large headroom.** 194,636 requests over ~30 min at 106.4 RPS: server-side **read p95 52 ms** (gate 600), **write p95 67 ms** (gate 900), **0.00000 % errors**, **peak dyno memory 80 MB** (gate 430), zero R14/R15, zero pool exhaustion, DB connections flat at **24/60 = 40 %** (gate <70 %).
- **Measurement correction:** raw k6 showed read p95 3.28 s, but minimum latency was 262 ms because the generator runs from Bangladesh against a US dyno. Heroku router `service=` time is the authoritative server-side metric. 120 RPS was not reached (106.4 achieved) — the generator's uplink was the limit, not the dyno; no capacity claim beyond the measured rate.
- **Credit/refund duplication PASS:** 12 concurrent same-key requests → `1×202 + 11×409`, exactly 1 job and 1 charge; sequential replay returns the identical stored `job_id`. (A first version reported a false PASS on 12×500s; the assertion was fixed so a 5xx can never pass.)
- **Worker gates PASS:** 100-job burst drained in **153 s** (gate <10 min), throughput 15.0–37.6 jobs/min (gate ≥15), warm queue wait p95 **19.7 s** (gate <20), cold pickup 44.3 s (gate <90), **zero duplicate output** across 160 jobs, poison job terminates as `failed`/`max_attempts`, **max replicas never exceeded 3**.
- **Cron: 6/6 executed manually and Succeeded**, incl. backup (proves the direct DSN works from Azure). `credit-reset` + `spend-alert` re-run → no duplicate effects. `daily-push` was deliberately timed at 06:38 UTC (all users UTC, push hour 8) so **zero real notifications** were sent.
- **⚠️ COST GATE FAILED on the first pass, then was fixed by rework — see below.** ACA billed allocated resources through the scale-down cooldown, pinning a 2 vCPU/4 GiB replica on at **~$150/mo vs the $16.67 ceiling**.
- **Two honest deferrals** (both caused by the DO bridge, not the platform): replica-kill recovery and recovery re-signal attribution can't be proven while DO's 120 s requeue beats Azure's 300 s lease — verify in Phase 6 after the DO worker stops.
- Total paid provider spend for the whole phase: **1 FASHN call (~$0.075)**, disclosed.
- New defect logged: unfetchable `person_image_url` → **500** instead of a typed `VALIDATION_ERROR` (§13 contract violation).

### Phase 5 remediation + close-out (authoritative — supersedes the two ⚠️ items above)

- **Architecture reworked: always-on Container Apps → event-driven Container Apps JOBS.** Jobs bill per execution, so the structural idle-billing problem is gone. Measured cost at 30k MAU: **$7.73/mo** (inside the $16.67 ceiling and the $12 preferred target); **$0.00/mo at beta load**. Obsolete worker Apps deleted from IaC *and* from Azure — they had been silently stealing test signals. Finite batch entrypoints terminate instead of looping; an all-error batch now exits **non-zero** rather than reporting `Succeeded`.
- **120 RPS gate PASSES — no longer deferred.** Re-run from a US-region GitHub runner (Chicago, `northcentralus`) co-located with the dyno: **119.997 RPS, 216,000 requests, exactly 30m00.0s, 0 dropped iterations, 0.00 % errors, read p95 47.28 ms, write p95 42.55 ms**, using only **14 of 1,500 VUs**. The earlier 106.4 RPS was confirmed to be generator-limited, not a capacity finding. A preflight now aborts the run if the synthetic identities fail to authenticate, so a run of pure 401s can never masquerade as a pass.
- **`VALIDATION_ERROR` contract fixed** (422 for an unfetchable image URL; `PROVIDER_ERROR` 503 fails **closed** on a moderation outage, per §19).
- **Cold-start accepted, not hidden.** Activation p95 ~100 s (image pull ~50 s + ONNX load ~43 s). The client shows a reassurance state at 45 s with a 3-min cap and **never** renders a false failure (6 regression tests). Choosing a smaller model is **deferred to post-cutover real-device evaluation** — it is a garment-quality decision, not a load-test one.
- **Test data cleaned to the exact baseline.** The k6 write mix creates outfits, so the runs left 48 synthetic users / 4,383 outfits / 553 items in the US project. Audited, then removed under domain+prefix guards: back to **27 `auth.users` / 28 `wardrobe_items`** with **zero** marker rows. Critically, marker-named rows owned by a **real** user = **0** — the load test never mutated production data. Queues drained (no Job execution since 16:25 UTC 2026-07-19); Storage untouched.
- **641 backend tests pass** (+14); `ruff check` clean after fixing an `E501` the remediation introduced. Pre-existing `ruff format` drift (61 files, inherited from `main`) intentionally left for its own commit.
- **Launch budget: $12/mo** (Heroku $12 + Azure $0 + Supabase free); $19.73/mo at 30k MAU.

## Change log

- **Bootstrap** — created `migration/heroku-azure` from `origin/main@98df3c3`; created this file; verified current-phase prerequisites.
- **Phase 0** — read-only discovery complete; wrote `DISCOVERY.md`, `ENV_MATRIX.md`, `PHASE_0_REPORT.md`; no infra changes. **APPROVED PHASE 0** with binding clarifications (media backup = Supabase Storage; admin → Heroku Eco `wtm-admin`; static → CF Pages + `/r/*`→Heroku; runtime DSN = Session Pooler 5432; R2 = encrypted backups only).
- **Phase 1** — encrypted backup + restore proof complete; wrote `BACKUP_MANIFEST.md`, `ROLLBACK_RUNBOOK.md`, `PHASE_1_REPORT.md`. DO snapshot taken; encrypted archive uploaded to R2 + restore-verified. **APPROVED PHASE 1**.
- **Phase 2** — code refactor + reproducible IaC complete (11 commits, DO unchanged); wrote `PHASE_2_REPORT.md`. 625 tests pass; migration 0044 created (not applied to prod). **APPROVED PHASE 2** (media→Storage; admin→Heroku Eco; static→CF Pages; DSN=Session Pooler 5432; R2=backups only).
- **Phase 3** — Tokyo → us-east-1 cutover COMPLETE + verified (US `ghzabbceoaoertatkjyg`). DB restored (all counts match, 0044 applied, FK ok), 120/120 Storage objects migrated, 143 URL rows rewritten, DO bridge repointed to US (Session Pooler 5432), smoke PASS. Tokyo retained cold. **Rollback boundary crossed.** Wrote `PHASE_3_REPORT.md` + `HUMAN_HANDOFF.md`. Pending: owner encrypts final dump; auth-provider config on US; admin-web rebuild. **APPROVED PHASE 3**.
- **Phase 4** — resumed after interruption (recovery audit first, nothing duplicated). Pushed the missing `wtm-rembg-worker` image; released the same immutable API artifact to Heroku staging + prod (prod v4, Basic ×1, `db:true`); registered `api.wearthemood.com` without touching DNS; deployed Azure `wtm-prod` in **`koreacentral`** (14 resources) after the Students subscription's region policy made the blueprint's `eastus` impossible (founder-approved). Fixed two defects in `main.bicep` (cron jobs were not actually disabled; missing `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` broke user-assigned MI auth). Proved the full async path on Azure with positive attribution, finalized the UTC cron table, created Azure budgets programmatically, verified Heroku ≤ $13. §13.4 admin/static routing **blocked** on the Cloudflare token + Eco subscription. Wrote `PHASE_4_REPORT.md`.
- **Phase 4 (amendment)** — gate reopened to correct a Heroku Eco cost error and finish the two deferred items. Eco is account-wide ($5 / 1,000 h shared), not per-app, so `wtm-admin` was created and deployed on Eco at $0 marginal and staging moved Basic→Eco; total $12/mo. Verified Eco sleep/wake, audited for pingers (none), recorded pool monitoring in `OPS_RUNBOOK.md` §5.1, verified `/r/*` against the Heroku candidate, and added `deploy/site/_headers` for the App Links content type. Cloudflare Pages deploy remains owner-gated on a valid scoped token. Awaiting `APPROVED PHASE 4`.
- **Phase 5** — load/throughput/failure/cost gates measured against staging + the US project with fully synthetic, DO-invisible data (0 residue). All performance, reliability and cron gates PASS; the **cost gate fails at the 30k MAU target** for a structural ACA billing reason (idle-but-billed replicas), corrected for beta/burst by lowering `cooldownPeriod` to 60 s. Wrote `PHASE_5_REPORT.md`. Production and DNS untouched; Azure still not routed. Awaiting `APPROVED PHASE 5`.
- **Phase 6 (queue blocker FIXED — Heroku wired to the Azure queues with a least-privilege SAS)** — minted an account SAS scoped **`services=q`, `resource-types=co`, `permissions=a` (add-only), https-only, 1-year expiry** (`se=2027-07-20`): it can enqueue and nothing else — no read, delete, or list. Managed identity was not an option because it does not exist outside Azure. Set `QUEUE_PROVIDER=azure`, `AZURE_QUEUE_JOBS=jobs`, `AZURE_QUEUE_ENRICHMENT=enrichment`, `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` on `wtm-api-prod` (44 vars now). Secret values were never printed or written to disk.
  - **⚠ Windows gotcha that nearly shipped a silent failure:** `heroku config:set` (and `az ... --sas-token`) go through a **`.cmd` shim, and cmd.exe treats `&` as a command separator**, so the SAS was truncated at its first parameter — the stored connection string came out **104 chars with no `sig=` and zero ampersands**. Because `enqueue_signal()` is best-effort and swallows failures, this would have failed **silently** in production. Re-set via the **Heroku Platform API from Python** (no shell), giving the correct **200-char** value with `sig=` and 6 ampersands. Any future secret containing `&` must not be passed through the CLI shims.
  - **Proven end-to-end, using the exact credential Heroku stores:** enqueue → **HTTP 201**; message confirmed present in `jobs`; **KEDA woke `wtm-rembg-job-kpmw9`** (11:59:07 → 12:00:44, Succeeded) which consumed it; queue back to **0**; **no DB residue**. This closes the gap that would have degraded every cutout/try-on to the 5-minute recovery poll.
  - Health after the config restart: Heroku prod `/readyz` 200, DO `api.wearthemood.com` 200, all four DO services running. **No DNS change; DO worker still running; Azure schedules still `0 0 31 2 *`.**
  - **Cron mapping for the cutover** (from the live ofelia config, the source of truth): news `@every 6h` → `0 */6 * * *` · spend-alert `@every 6h` → `0 */6 * * *` · backup `@daily` → `0 0 * * *` · credit-reset `@daily` → `0 0 * * *` · daily-push `@hourly` → `0 * * * *` · giveaway-chats `@hourly` → `0 * * * *`. **daily-push is safe to run hourly** — it only notifies users whose *local* hour equals `DAILY_PUSH_HOUR`, so an hourly trigger does not blast everyone.
- **Phase 6 (DNS cutover authorized, then HALTED pre-flip on a queue check)** — `AUTHORIZE DNS CUTOVER` was given. Before changing the record, the plan's queue/worker precondition was checked and **failed**: `wtm-api-prod` has **40 config vars and not one of `QUEUE_PROVIDER` / `AZURE_QUEUE_JOBS` / `AZURE_QUEUE_ENRICHMENT` / `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME` / `AZURE_STORAGE_QUEUE_ENDPOINT` / `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` / `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`**, so `queue_provider` falls back to its `"stub"` default and the API's `enqueue_signal()` is an in-memory no-op.
  - **Why that breaks the cutover:** `wtm-rembg-job` and `wtm-ai-orchestrator-job` are **Event-triggered (KEDA on queue depth)** and never poll the DB. Today the DO worker's 2 s DB poll is what actually picks up work. After a flip, DO's worker is stopped and the Heroku API emits no queue signal, so **nothing would wake a worker**: every cutout and try-on would sit `queued` until the recovery job's stranded scan finds it — **up to 5 min + ~100 s cold start**, and only if recovery is enabled (it is currently `0 0 31 2 *`). A core user-facing path would be silently degraded, not broken loudly.
  - **Action taken: none.** DNS record untouched (still `A → 159.65.248.247`, proxied), DO `worker`+`ofelia` left running, Azure schedules left disabled, ACM left as-is. No rollback was needed because nothing was changed.
  - **Fix required before re-attempting:** the Heroku API needs credentials to write to the Azure Storage queues. The workers use a **user-assigned managed identity, which is not available outside Azure**, so Heroku cannot reuse it — it needs `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` or (preferably, least-privilege) a **SAS scoped to just the `jobs` + `enrichment` queues**, plus `QUEUE_PROVIDER=azure` and the queue names. That is a new credential in Heroku config — a security decision for the owner, and outside "change only `api.wearthemood.com`".
- **Phase 6 (FINAL deterministic preflight — check 1 PASS; all three checks now proven)** — window **09:18:52Z → 09:23:54Z (~5 min)**. Seeded exactly one row in the true abandoned state and proved the 0046 recovery path end to end.
  - **Seed (BEFORE):** `cutout_status='processing'`, `attempt_count=1`, `cutout_locked_at=09:04:30` (**age 901 s**, stale past the 300 s window), `cutout_last_signal_at=NULL` (no queue message), `cutout_url=NULL` (no output). Deliberately `updated_at=09:19:30` (**fresh**) — under the pre-0046 design that alone made the row invisible to recovery and unclaimable, so a PASS here can only come from the new lease column.
  - **Recovery re-signalled it:** execution **`wtm-prod-recovery-j3l75we`** (09:20:18 → 09:20:48, Succeeded) set `cutout_last_signal_at=09:20:44` and bumped `updated_at=09:20:44` — while **`cutout_locked_at` stayed 09:04:30, untouched**. That is precisely the decoupling 0046 introduces; the old code reset the lease here and livelocked.
  - **Azure re-claimed and completed it:** execution **`wtm-rembg-job-xlk7v`** (started 09:20:26) claimed the stale row, stamping a fresh lease `cutout_locked_at=09:21:48` and incrementing **`attempt_count` 1 → 2**; finished `cutout_status='done'` with `cutout_url` SET at `updated_at=09:22:30`. DO was stopped throughout, so attribution is unambiguous.
  - **All 10 pass criteria PASS:** re-signalled · `attempt_count` 1→2 · completed · output produced · exactly 1 wardrobe row (no duplicate output) · no `tryon_results` / `generated_images` / `tryon_jobs` / `ai_jobs` rows created · **no credit charge or refund**.
  - **Closed:** synthetic data removed (**baseline 28 items / 27 users, 0 residue**), Azure recovery + all six crons back to `0 0 31 2 *`, DO `worker`+`ofelia` restarted (all four services up), health verified (api 200, site 200, `/r/*` 302, 0 actionable rows). No kill experiment; **no DNS change**.
  - **PREFLIGHT COMPLETE — all three mandatory checks proven:** replica-kill recovery ✅ (this run) · recovery re-signal attribution ✅ · DO/Azure never overlap ✅.
- **Phase 6 (preflight re-run after the 0046 fix — 2 PASS, check 1 INCONCLUSIVE; window closed cleanly)** — repointed only the required worker-plane Jobs to the CI images built from `a6d0cde` (`wtm-rembg-job` → `12016768`, `wtm-prod-recovery` + `wtm-ai-orchestrator-job` → `44680cb2`; the six dormant crons deliberately left on `b9817f63`). Window **08:53:35Z → 09:12:53Z** (~19 min, slightly over the ~15 authorized — noted).
  - **Check 2 — recovery re-signal attribution: ✅ PASS (again).** 30 rows seeded `queued` with `cutout_last_signal_at` NULL; recovery signalled them and Azure completed **30/30 `done`** with real cutouts, DO stopped throughout.
  - **Check 3 — no DO/Azure overlap: ✅ PASS.** DO worker down **08:53:35Z**, Azure recovery enabled **08:54:00Z** (25 s later, never concurrent); no DO participation observed for the whole window.
  - **Check 1 — replica-kill recovery: ⚠️ INCONCLUSIVE (not a failure).** `az containerapp job stop` was issued mid-batch (08:56:31Z) but the container **finished the in-flight row before terminating**, so no claim was ever abandoned: the target row reached `done` at `attempt_count=1`, and all 30 rows completed. With no orphaned row in existence there was nothing for recovery to re-claim, so the fix's recovery path was **not exercised**. This is a limitation of the kill technique, **not** evidence of a defect — and notably the same thing happened on the previous attempt, suggesting `job stop` does not abort mid-row.
  - **Partial positive evidence for 0046:** the lease is now visibly decoupled from `updated_at` — the target row carried `cutout_locked_at=08:57:09` while `updated_at=08:58:12` (completion). Under the old design those were the same column; the claim now stamps a lease that later writes to the row do not move. That is the exact decoupling the livelock fix depends on, though it is **not** yet end-to-end proof of recovery.
  - **Closed per instruction:** synthetic data removed (**baseline 28 items / 27 users**), Azure recovery back to `0 0 31 2 *`, DO `worker`+`ofelia` restarted (all four services up), health verified (api 200, site 200, `/r/*` 302). **No DNS change; cutover not begun; `AUTHORIZE DNS CUTOVER` NOT requested** because check 1 did not pass.
  - **To settle check 1 deterministically** (~3 min, needs a short DO-stopped window): insert a row directly in the post-abandonment state — `cutout_status='processing'`, `attempt_count=1`, `cutout_locked_at` older than `worker_stale_seconds` — then run recovery and confirm an Azure execution re-claims it with `attempt_count` 1→2 and completes it. This is the same isolation technique Phases 4–5 used and exercises exactly the path 0046 fixes, without racing a kill.
- **Phase 6 (mandatory preflight RUN — 2 of 3 pass, check 1 FAILS on a real defect; rolled back)** — with a verified Cloudflare token, executed the coordinated cutover point: stopped DO `worker`+`ofelia` at **08:09:54Z** (api+caddy kept up; API and site stayed 200 throughout) and enabled Azure recovery at **08:11:13Z**.
  - **Check 2 — recovery re-signal attribution: ✅ PASS.** 10 synthetic rows seeded `queued` with `cutout_last_signal_at` NULL (no queue message). A `wtm-prod-recovery` run stamped all 10 and an Azure execution completed **10/10 `done`, `attempt_count=1`, real cutouts** — work nothing else could have woken, with DO stopped. (This exercises the stranded-`queued` fix from `f4be7ce`.)
  - **Check 3 — no DO/Azure overlap: ✅ PASS.** DO worker went down **79 s before** Azure recovery was enabled, and the stranded row below sat untouched from 08:18:50Z well past **08:26:51Z** — far beyond DO's 120 s `requeue_stale`, which would certainly have fired had DO been live. The two planes provably never ran concurrently.
  - **Check 1 — replica-kill recovery attribution: ❌ FAIL (genuine defect).** Killed `wtm-rembg-job-pqshx` mid-batch, stranding row `4976821f` in `processing`/`attempt_count=1`. It was **never recovered**. Root cause is a **livelock**: cutout leases use `wardrobe_items.updated_at`, but recovery's re-signal (`update … set cutout_last_signal_at = now()`) fires **`trg_wardrobe_items_updated_at` → `set_updated_at()`**, which resets `updated_at`. The worker then cannot claim (`updated_at` no longer older than `worker_stale_seconds`), deletes the signal as a no-op, and the cycle repeats every recovery pass — the row is re-signalled forever and never re-claimed. Observed `updated_at` moving `08:18:50 → 08:25:25` while `attempt_count` stayed at 1.
  - **Impact:** cutouts only. `tryon_jobs`/`ai_jobs` are unaffected because they lease on a dedicated `locked_at` column that recovery never writes. **Pre-existing** (0044-era design), not introduced by the stranded-queued fix. After cutover Azure is the sole worker plane, so any crashed/scaled-in replica would strand a user's item in "processing" permanently — hence a hard cutover blocker.
  - **Rollback executed exactly as specified:** Azure recovery → `0 0 31 2 *`; synthetic data removed (**back to baseline 28 items / 27 users**); DO `worker`+`ofelia` restarted (all four services running); health verified (`api.wearthemood.com` 200, `wearthemood.com` 200, `/r/*` 302, 0 actionable rows). **No DNS change, no ACM change beyond the earlier enable, nothing routed.** Stopped without further experiments.
  - **Pre-existing issue noted (not caused here):** the droplet's `admin-web` container has been `exited` since **2026-07-18T17:10:43Z**, so `wearthemood.com/mood-ops-console-7x9` returns **502** — it was already down before this work began.
  - **Fix required before re-running the preflight:** stop the cutout re-signal from resetting its own lease — e.g. give cutouts a dedicated lease column (mirroring `locked_at`), or perform the re-signal in a way that does not fire the `updated_at` trigger.
- **Phase 6 (cutover prep — BLOCKED on the Cloudflare token before touching the DO worker)** — ran the "finish Phase 6" sequence to the point of the production-impacting action, then stopped. **Step 1 done:** synced the `GIT_SHA` stamp step to `main` (PR #2 merged; main's `migration-deploy.yml` now matches the branch). **Step 2 done:** enabled Heroku ACM on `wtm-api-prod` — status `Failing — CDN not returning HTTP challenge`, which is expected because DNS still points at Cloudflare→DO; ACM completes at cutover (step 6). **Step 3 BLOCKED:** `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` is present (len 53) and authenticates, but it reaches only `Servicerabbi@gmail.com's Account` and enumerates **0 zones** — it has no access to the `wearthemood.com` zone, so it can neither read the DNS record nor perform the cutover edit. **Steps 4–5 NOT started:** deliberately did **not** stop the DigitalOcean worker/ofelia — that is the migration's most consequential production action, and starting it commits to a DNS cutover that this token cannot complete, which would strand production on the slow recovery bridge while waiting for a token fix. Correct path: obtain a Zone:Read + DNS:Edit token for the account that owns `wearthemood.com`, then run the three preflight checks + DNS gate + cutover in one coordinated window. Production fully intact: DO all four services running, `api.wearthemood.com` 200, Azure recovery still `0 0 31 2 *`.
- **Phase 6 (Heroku prod RELEASED through gated CI)** — owner approved the re-run; `migration-deploy` `29723080914` went **green on every step** — Heroku login (real creds), build + push (no OCI-manifest failure on the GitHub runner), and release. Prod is now **`wtm-api-prod` v5** (2026-07-20T07:19Z) built from **`0851595`** (the remediated backend with the §F `VALIDATION_ERROR`/`PROVIDER_ERROR` fix; §F itself covered by unit tests, verified-by-deploy not live-probed to avoid a paid job). `/readyz` 200 `db:true`, `/healthz` 200, `/v1/health` 200. **Still unrouted** — this only makes the candidate current, no traffic moved. **Known wart:** the CI release step does not set `GIT_SHA`, so `/readyz` still reports `commit 17a3a8c` though the running code is `0851595` — cosmetic, fix by adding a `GIT_SHA` step to the workflow (recommended) or setting the config var. Did **not** set it (would create a release; owner said no manual deploy). DNS/ACM/Azure schedules/DO untouched.
- **Phase 6 (Heroku CI secrets set; deploy re-paused at the gate)** — created a dedicated Heroku authorization for GitHub Actions (id `70a12062…`, desc `github-actions-wtm-prod-deploy`, global scope) and set **`HEROKU_API_KEY` + `HEROKU_EMAIL` as `production`-environment secrets** (not repo-wide, per owner instruction) — the token was piped straight into `gh secret set` and **never printed or logged** (only its length + the authorization id were shown). Verified both at env level; repo-wide still only `LOADTEST_USERS_JSON`. Re-ran `29723080914`; it **re-paused at the `production` gate** (pending deployment env=production, reviewer getRabbi, can_approve=true). No step ran; prod still v4 (`17a3a8c`), `/readyz` 200. Did **not** approve, hand-deploy, or touch DNS/ACM/Azure schedules/DO.
- **Phase 6 (CI prod deploy triggered, approved, failed on missing secrets)** — PR #1 was found still **open** (the owner believed it merged; it had not), so merged it (`migration-deploy.yml` now on `main`, HEAD `ff53a1f`). Verified the `production` gate (getRabbi required reviewer; `total_count` 0→1). Dispatched `migration-deploy` `target=prod` against `--ref migration/heroku-azure` (run `29723080914`); it correctly **paused at the gate**, the owner **approved**, and it then **failed at step 3 "Log in to the Heroku container registry"** — the command rendered as `docker login … -u "" --password-stdin` with an empty key, i.e. **`HEROKU_API_KEY` and `HEROKU_EMAIL` are not set** (repo has only `LOADTEST_USERS_JSON`; no env-level secrets). Build/push/release (steps 4–5) were **skipped**, so prod is **untouched — still v4, `17a3a8c`, `/readyz` 200**. The gate itself worked end to end; the only gap is credentials. Fix: set `HEROKU_API_KEY` (a Heroku authorization token) + `HEROKU_EMAIL`, then re-run (re-approval required). Not hand-deployed; DNS untouched, nothing routed.
- **Phase 6 (CI pipeline unblocked + Azure on CI images)** — owner linked the three GHCR packages to the repo and set Manage Actions access to **Write**; `migration-build` (`29719952866`, `099f1d9`) then went **green**, publishing `wtm-api` `e1add1cd`, `wtm-orchestrator` `b9817f63`, `wtm-rembg-worker` `1749dea3` — each verified in GHCR three ways (registry `@digest`, commit-SHA tag match, Packages API version present + linked repo). Repointed the **8 orchestrator-image Jobs** from the hand-pushed `2db2601f` to the CI-built **`b9817f63`** (same recovery code — backend diff `18bb4ac`↔`099f1d9` is docs-only, and the image was inspected to contain the stranded scans). Image-only update: all 7 cron schedules still `0 0 31 2 *`; one `wtm-prod-recovery` run **Succeeded** on the new digest (0 actionable rows → no-op). `wtm-rembg-job` repointed too (see next entry). DO production untouched (200), DNS unchanged, recovery still dormant.
- **Phase 6 (rembg Job on the CI image)** — repointed `wtm-rembg-job` from the pre-CI `b04e6c92` to the CI-built **`1749dea3`** (event-triggered, so image-only; trigger still `Event`). Model presence is guaranteed by the Dockerfile's build-time assertion (`test -s /models/u2net.onnx`, line 32) which a green build cannot skip; additionally a manual execution **Succeeded** and its log confirmed `rembg job ready in 43.4s (model loaded once)` then `processed=0 … errors=0 reason=idle` — proving the 1.5 GB image pulls under the managed identity, the ONNX model loads at runtime (not a swallowed warm-up failure), the DB is reachable, and it exits clean as a no-op. Running it while DO is live is safe: the batch worker wakes only from the Azure `jobs` queue, and the DO API never populates that queue, so it can never contend with DO for a row. **Now every Azure worker runs a CI-provenanced image.** Queue 0, DO 200, DNS unchanged.
- **Phase 6 (prod held for CI)** — owner's call 2026-07-20: **do not hand-push prod**; release it through CI so the `production` environment review gate is honoured. Prod stays on stale `17a3a8c` (unrouted, harmless until cutover, must be current before the DNS flip). Confirmed the "just add a source label" and "delete + recreate the package" shortcuts do **not** work (the 403 precedes the manifest push; and every Azure Job pins a digest inside the unlinked `wtm-orchestrator` package, so deleting it breaks the running jobs). Wrote the ordered CI-release path into `ROLLBACK_RUNBOOK.md`; the one hard blocker is the owner granting Actions Write on the three GHCR packages. No infra changed this step.
- **Phase 6 (deploy the fix)** — after the preflight below, deployed the recovery fix to where it actually runs. `recovery.py` runs as the **Azure** `wtm-prod-recovery` Job (not on Heroku), from the `wtm-orchestrator` image pinned by digest, so a Heroku-only release would have been a silent no-op. Applied migration `0045` to the US DB (3 indexes verified). Built `wtm-orchestrator` from `18bb4ac`, pushed `sha256:2db2601f…`, and repointed **all 8** orchestrator-image jobs (image only — all 7 cron schedules still `0 0 31 2 *`, verified). Verified the new digest actually runs in Azure: one `wtm-prod-recovery` execution **Succeeded in 31 s** after asserting 0 `queued`/`processing` rows (guaranteed no-op; DB unchanged after). Found the Heroku candidate **21 commits stale** (both apps on Phase-3 `17a3a8c`, predating the whole Phase 5 remediation incl. the §F contract fix) and released **staging** to `18bb4ac` (v37, `/readyz` `db:true`, typed §13 envelope confirmed; §F path itself covered by unit tests, not live-probed to avoid creating a paid job on the shared DB). **Heroku prod deliberately NOT released** — with `migration-deploy` unusable it must be pushed by hand, which bypasses the `production` environment review gate, so it awaits the owner's explicit go. Uncovered + documented four delivery-pipeline defects (GHCR packages unlinked → CI 403; `ruff format` gate skipped the image build, now cleared in `18bb4ac`; `migration-deploy` not dispatchable + Heroku rejects OCI manifests; the stale candidate). Recovery schedule remains disabled — the fix ships dormant. DO production untouched, DNS unchanged, Azure not routed.
- **Phase 6 (preflight)** — `APPROVED PHASE 6` received 2026-07-20; preflight run, **cutover NOT executed**. Preflight found a **correctness defect that would have caused silent data loss at cutover**: `app.tasks.recovery` only ever scanned stale `'processing'` rows, so a row whose best-effort wake signal never reached the queue stayed `'queued'` forever — even though `enqueue_signal`'s own docstring names recovery as the backstop. The batch workers wake only from queue messages and never poll for `'queued'` rows. Because the **DO API cannot enqueue to Azure at all** (no queue vars on the droplet), stopping the DO worker per blueprint §15.3 would have stranded every new background-removal request. Fixed: recovery now also re-signals stranded `'queued'` rows (NULL/stale signal timestamp), with migration `0045` adding the partial indexes and 2 regression tests. **643 tests pass.** Wrote the exact cutover + rollback commands into `ROLLBACK_RUNBOOK.md`. Cutover remains blocked on: (1) deploying this fix, (2) **Heroku ACM is disabled** so there is no TLS cert for `api.wearthemood.com`, (3) no Cloudflare **Zone·Read + Zone·DNS·Edit** token. DigitalOcean production untouched and still serving; DNS unchanged; Azure still not routed.
- **Phase 5 — APPROVED 2026-07-20** (`APPROVED PHASE 5`, at `cd00da0`). Scope was narrowed by the founder to **launch-readiness**, explicitly not 30k-MAU certification: 30k-MAU worker sizing, bg-removal cold start / model choice, and pre-existing `ruff format` drift are **deferred post-cutover** and must not be reopened as migration blockers. Work stops here — **Phase 6 not started**, production DNS unchanged, DigitalOcean production still running.
- **Phase 5 (remediation + close-out)** — reopened after the first pass failed on cost, on the unproven 120 RPS gate, and on a §13 contract violation. Reworked the worker plane from always-on Container Apps to **event-driven Container Apps Jobs** ($150/mo → **$7.73/mo** at 30k MAU) and deleted the obsolete Apps; added finite batch entrypoints with truthful non-zero exit; fixed the `VALIDATION_ERROR`/`PROVIDER_ERROR` contract; added client UX so a ~100 s cold start is never shown as failure. Re-ran the load gate from a **US-region** runner and **passed 120 RPS outright** (216,000 reqs, 0 errors, 0 dropped, read p95 47 ms). Audited and removed all synthetic residue back to the exact Phase 3 baseline (27 users / 28 items), verified queues drained and DO production untouched. Scope was explicitly narrowed to **launch-readiness**: 30k-MAU headroom, bg-removal model choice, and cold-start tuning are **deferred post-cutover**. **Phase 5 COMPLETE — hard stop.**
- **Phase 4 (deferred item closed)** — Cloudflare Pages candidate deployed + preview-verified on `wtm-site` (preview branch `migration-candidate`) with an Account·Pages-only token; landing, legal, `_headers`, Android asset links and the Apple association file (200 `application/json`, no redirect) all verified. **No production DNS changed**; no custom domain attached. Recorded delta: Pages 308-redirects `.html` to the canonical extensionless URL where Caddy serves it at 200 — update published legal URLs at Phase 6.
